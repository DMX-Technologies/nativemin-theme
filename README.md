## Custom CSS For Webmin/Virtualmin

![Screenshot of main Webmin dashboard](https://github.com/nativeit-dev/webmin-native-theme/blob/master/screenshots/dashboard.png?raw=true)

**This repository contains the custom CSS that I created for use with the Webmin Authentic Theme via its *Theme Extensions* interface.**

All of the changes were made using pure CSS without altering any theme files or Webmin source, so the relatively frequent update schedule for these projects should not affect my UI changes unless there are major breaking changes made to the UI elements or their class selectors.

All custom fonts and colors were declared as variables at the top of the file, and these variables were employed at every possible opportunity in order to make changes to the style and typography as straightforward and simple as possible. 

NOTE: *Background images are included for demo purposes. I have licensed these images for my own use through [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/abstract-ink-backgrounds-DUEAQ4), but I *do not have the rights to distribute the images*, and you do not have the rights to use them. Please be considerate to both the author of the images and myself by not copying them without a license, or hotlinking to where they are hosted on my server. If you would like to obtain a license for them, you can find them [here](https://elements.envato.com/abstract-ink-backgrounds-DUEAQ4).*

### Open source assets employed:
  - [Oswald](github.com/googlefonts/OswaldFont) font by Vernon Adams
  - [Barlow](https://github.com/jpt/barlow) font by Jeremy Tribby
  - [Inconsolata](github.com/googlefonts/inconsolata) font by Raph Levien
  - Other misc. fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) have at times been imported and/or included in the variables as examples of other typefaces that happen to work well in this design. Alternative body fonts include other sans-serif typefaces such as Lato, Public Sans, and Roboto. If lowercase type isn't necessary for headings, Bebas Neue is a great alternative for Oswald (Bebas Neue Pro has recently added the benefit of full case and glyph options). I preferred smaller, more condensed monospace/code font options, and Source Code Pro or IBM Plex Mono are both great options.

  - [Virtualmin](https://github.com/virtualmin) is a *fantastic* full-featured open source web hosting control panel for Linux and *BSD systems that has been developed over the course of now decades by a [dedicated and talented team of developers](https://github.com/virtualmin/virtualmin-gpl/graphs/contributors). If you aren't already aware of Virtualmin, it is an exceptional solution that balances the ease-of-use of most server control panels with an otherwise unique and in-depth suite of powerful features to help automate and streamline just about every routine server administration task, along with several other mission-specific use cases such as shared web hosting, applicaiton development, and enterprise infrastructure provisioning and maintenance.
